# My JS PokeDex | Listing PokeAPI Pokemons
PokeDex created with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS, original work on the Florin Pop channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL68br6JyYs).

In this nice portfolio, I learned how to use **asynchronous JavaScript** (with the **Fetch()** library) to access the PokeAPI, to fetch data from different pokemons.

While the data arrived, I built an **HTML template**, to store the data coming from the API.

And finally, I have a beautiful interface, implemented with rich visual effects, using **CSS3**, with its amazing properties!

## Techniques and concepts

- HTML template, rendered by JavaScript
- Amazing CSS properties
- Display Flexbox
- And much more!
